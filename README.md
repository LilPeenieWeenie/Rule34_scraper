# Rule34_scraper
If you don't know what this does already.. I don't know what to tell you

Instructions:
1. open either the downloader or the totxt file (to do this cd to directory and type in the name of file)
ex: cd /home/usr -> python3 hscraper_download2.py

2. this will grant you with a prompt that asks you what you want to search for
   remember with great power comes great responsibiltiy
   ex: chainsaw_man (make sure to have _ as space)
   
3. once you have entered your choice it will ask where you want to save it 
   ex: /home/(your user)/Pictures
   NOTE: make sure you don't end the directory with a / 
   
4. Thats it! If you opened the download file script you will now have a lot of pngs and jpgs of your fav char
   HAVE FUN :)
